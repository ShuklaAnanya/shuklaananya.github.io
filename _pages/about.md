<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi! I'm a Visiting Scholar at [Microsoft Research Bangalore](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/), where I am advised by [Dr. Mercy Ranjit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mercypeter/?originalSubdomain=in) and work closely with [Dr Rina Bao](https://baorina.github.io) and [Dr Yangming Ou](https://research.childrenshospital.org/researchers/yangming-ou). My research focuses on geometric reasoning and representation learning in vision-language models, with a particular emphasis on radiology and medical imaging.

I am completing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at [Plaksha University](https://plaksha.edu.in). I have spent summers conducting research in machine learning for biology at [Brown University](https://dsi.brown.edu) with [Dr. Brenda Rubenstein](https://dsi.brown.edu/people/brenda-rubenstein) and at [CDS, IISc](https://cds.iisc.ac.in) Bangalore with [Dr. Debnath Pal](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/debnath-pal/).

My website is being developed right now. This page will be updated soon!
